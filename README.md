# quiz-show-time
## Limited progress
I struggled mightily with this week's homework. 

I was able to execute the timer after several attempts. I created an opening page with a Boostrap Jumbotron that introduced the quiz. Once the start button is clicked, it opens the second page.

The second page features a two-column row. The first column is where the questions should appear. I was unable to get my quiz.js questions to correctly appear as buttons in my html, which was what I was aiming to achieve. 

My timer appears on the right. I styled it with Boostrap and got it to count down to zero after several fits and starts. 

I'm hoping to go back and improve/finish this project once I have a better grasp of JavaScript syntax.
