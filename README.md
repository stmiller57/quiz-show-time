# quiz-show-time
## Slow progress
This project took a lot of time and research for me to code a workable quiz. I was unable to complete all the functionality but at least produced code that ran through the five-question quiz I designed. 

I started with an intro page using a Bootstrap Jumbotron to introduce my five-question sports quiz. I originally had the start button open a second html page, but after discussing the project with classmates and Trilogy instructors, I realized I needed to include most of the html on the index page.

## Next steps
I next worked on the JavaScript code to generate questions after the start button is clicked as well as the timer.

I completed the timer first, placing it to the far right using Bootstrap's grid system. I placed the container for the quiz questions next to it on the left.

The biggest challenge was finding how to hide and show elements based on various click events. I eventually produced a quick that featured three screens in one html page â€” the intro, the quiz and the finish screens.

## Work to do
I'm hoping to go back and improve/finish this project once I have a better grasp of local storage. 

While I built the basic part of a form that will take you to another html page where scores will be logged, I ran out of time to add and store scores.
